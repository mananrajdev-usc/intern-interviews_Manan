      <p> I am Manan Rajdev, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California. I am an International student currently looking for a job in the field of Data Science, Algorithms, Big Data and/or Deep Learning.</p>
      <p> I am flexible to the following job positions as I am allowed to restructure my university curriculum accordingly-
<li> Internship in Summer 2021  </li>
<li> Co-op from Fall 2021 </li>
<li> Full-time from Winter 2021/Spring 2022 </li></p>
      <p> My firm understanding of the foundational principles underlies the world of Algorithms and Data Science. I aspire now to build on this bedrock of knowledge and seek to pursue this internship and to understand practical applications so as to gain mastery over the principles and structures of Statistical Analysis, Data Management, Algorithms, Data Mining, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Cloud platforms. My extra-curricular activities helped me in understanding the team mechanics and an amazing team player, while teaching me the responsibilities of a team leader.</p>
	  <p> To this end, I have been a meritorious student throughout and I am always willing to dedicate my time and efforts to learn , perform and excel. I look forward to working under the learned guidance of experienced data scientists at Paypal. I have worked tirelessly to build my familiarity with this field through a plethora of courses and co-curricular activities, and I am certain that this tenacity and dedication will help me face up to all the challenges I may be faced by as I work in the internship. I believe that my perseverance, discipline, intelligence, and diligence will help me carve a niche for myself at the workplace.  </p>
